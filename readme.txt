# Project-1 for CS-5120

---------------------------

Coded In: Python

---------------------------

Execution:

To Compile and Run code please use the following command:
python3 <filename.py> 
#To run all algorithm filename = main.py
#For individual algorithm filename should be merge.py for Merge, insertion.py for Insertion, heap.py for Heap, merge_3_way.py for 3 way merge.

and then Enter File Path to input files(folder)
Example: Enter a file name : <list_20000.txt>

NOTE: These commands are to be executed for running code on Linux

The output will be generated in output.txt with following sequence
>"number of elements", "comparison count", "time taken by sorting algorith after data reading from file( time in miliseconds)"

On run for all algorithm the sequence of output for each algorith
Merge
Insertion
Heap
3-way Merge

example:-_

```200000, 261015, 120
200000, 99889268, 17134
200000, 242836, 123
200000, 305810, 99```


On run for individual algorithm the  output for  algorithm is 1 line output
example:-_

```200000, 2777856, 123```
